     <p style="text-align:left"> In this project, I created a simple webpage using HTML, CSS & JSS which will introduce you to most widely used
       encryption mechanism called as<b> RSA Algorithm</b>. It also has a live demonstration where a user can input a secret message, get their private and
       public keys, once they get their keys they can see how the encrypted version of their secret message would look like. They can also decrypt the encrypted message
       to see the secret message.
     </p>

     <h1>What is RSA algorithm ?</h1>

              <p style="text-align:left"> The name RSA algorithm came from its founder <b>RIVEST SHAMIR ADLEMAN</b>. The algorithm was introduced in the year 1978.
              RSA algorithm is an assymertic encryption where assymertic means that two opposite keys are operating and they are private key
              and public key. RSA was also best known and widely used public key for Encryption and Decryption of the data.</p>


              <p style="text-align:left-right">Encryption is the one converting plaintext into cipher text where as Decryption converts cipher text into plain text by the secret key that was sent by the sender to receiver.<br>
 It is an asymmetric (public key) cryptosystem based on number theory, which is a block cipher system.
</p>
<h2><b>Working of RSA algorithm</b></h2>
<p>It's algorithm can be used for both public key encryption and digital signatures. Its security is based on the difficulty of solving certain mathematical problems such as factoring large integers.</p>
      <p>The working of an RSA algorithm contains three steps:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><p>Generation of keys </p></li>
        <li><p>Encryption</p></li>
        <li><p>Decryption</p></li>
        </ol>
  <br>
  <ul>

<li><h2><b>Generation of keys : </b></h2></li>

<ul>
      <li><p>Step 1:  Take two prime numbers x and y.</p></li>
      <li><p>Step 2:  Multiply the two prime numbers and store the result in the variable
                    called n i.e. n = x*y.
</p></li>
         <li><p>Step 3:  Calculate the totient function.
                       ϕ (n) = (x−1) (y−1).
<ul>
                  <li><p>Note: Euler's totient function (also called the Phi function) counts the number of positive integers less than n that are co-prime to n. </p></li>
</ul>
</p></li>
        <li><p>Step 4 :  Select an integer e such it is co-prime to that totient function and also  e < ϕ(n) This pair of keys also called as public key i.e. (n, e)
</p></li>
        <li><p>Step 5: Calculate d such that e.d = 1 mod phi (n).
	                	This pair of keys also called as public key i.e. (n, d).
                    <ul>
                    <li><p>Note: To calculate d value, wolfram alpha compute engine is used. To get d, please use e^(-1) mod phi(n). </p></li>
                  </ul>
</p></li>
  </ul>
        <li><h2><b>Encryption : </b></h2>
          <p>Encryption is used for converting plain text into cipher text . Encryption contains the public key .</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p><b>C=P^e mod n</b></p></li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><h2><b>Decryption : </b></h2></li>
  <p>Decryption is used for converting plain text into cipher text . Decryption contains the private key .</p>
  <ul>
    <li><p><b>P=C^d mod n.</b></p></li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<h2><b>Advantages of RSA Algorithm :</b></h2>
<ol>
  <li><p>RSA is stronger than any other symmetric key algorithm.</p></li>
  <li><p>RSA has overcome the weakness of symmetric algorithm
            i.e. Authenticity and confidentiality.
</p></li>
<li><p>RSA algorithm is safe and secure for its users through the use of
 Complex mathematics.
</p></li>
<li><p>RSA algorithm is hard to crack since it involves factorization of prime
numbers which are difficult to factorize.
</p></li>
<li><p>RSA algorithm uses the public key to encrypt data and the key is
            known to everyone, therefore, it is easy to share the public key.
</p></li>

</ol>
<h2><b>Disadvantages of RSA algorithm : </b></h2>
<ol>
  <li><p>RSA algorithm can be very slow in cases where large data needs to be encrypted by the same computer</p></li>
  <li><p>It requires a third party to verify the reliability of public keys.</p></li>
</ol>
